# Roblox-Avatar-Change-Detector
Detect when a user's outfit changes. Can be useful if they are putting an asset on then shortly taking it off and you're trying to find the asset they're wearing. 

### How do I use this? 

Download the source for the file then just run it using node. Pass the userid of the player you wish to detect avatar changes for (~~stalk~~). 

ex. `node watcher.js 39939779`
